Title: Sequential BART for Imputation of Missing Covariate
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Dandan Xu, Michael Daniels
Maintainer: Aarti Singh <mdstat2016@gmail.com>
Description: Sequential BART is a flexible Bayesian non-parametric approach 
     to impute the missing covariate which involves factoring the joint distribution
     of the covariate with missing-ness into a set of sequential conditionals
     and applying Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to model each of these Univariate conditionals. 
     The published journal can be found at <https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw009>
     Package provides a function, seqBART(), which computes and returns the imputed values.
