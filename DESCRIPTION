Title: Sequential BART for Imputation of Missing Covariates
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Daniels
Maintainer: Michael Daniels <mdstat2016@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements the sequential BART approach to impute the missing covariates. The
     algorithm applies a Bayesian nonparametric approach on factored sets of sequential conditionals of the joint 
     distribution of the covariates and the missingness and applying the Bayesian additive regresssion trees to model 
     each of these univariate conditionals. Each conditional distribution is then sampled using MCMC algorithm. 
     Package provides a function serBARTfunc which computes and returns the imputed values.
