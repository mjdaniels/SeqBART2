\title{Sequential Bayesian Additive Regression Trees Model}
\usage{
seqBART(x, y, x.type, y.type = 1, numimpute = 5, numskip = 199,
  burn = 1000, sigest = NA, seed = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Dataset of covariate matrix with missing values (NAs).}

\item{y}{Response (fully observed).}

\item{x.type}{A vector indicating the type of covariates (0=continuous, 1=binary).}

\item{y.type}{0=no reponse, 1=continuous response (linear regression used for imputation) and 2=binary response (logistic regression used for imputation), default value = 1}

\item{numimpute}{Number of Imputed Datasets, default = 5}

\item{numskip}{Number of iterations skipped, default = 199}

\item{burn}{Number of iterations for burn-in, default value = 1000}

\item{sigest}{For continuous variable, an estimate of error variance, sigma^2, used to calibrate an inverse-chi-squared prior used on that parameter. If not supplied, the least-squares estimate is derived instead. See sigquant for more information. Not applicable when variable is binary. Default value is NA.}

\item{seed}{is the value that will used to generate the distributions and draws with. Default value is NA.}
}
\value{
Imputed Dataset Values named as 'ximpute'.
}
\description{
A flexible Bayesian nonparametric model that is used as imputation tool for missing covariates.
